      <h2>This is my first html blog post</h2>
      <p>I have started learning html today and I am going to write this blog weekly with an update of my learning journey. I am planning to learn html and css and then
      JS and a frontend framework like reactjs. I will try implementing my learning by working on short projects and upload them here along with some experiences I have
      while working on them. I hope this journey will be exciting. </p>
